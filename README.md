# MatrixParserAndMultiplier


This repository contains a C++ program that reads, parses, and multiplies two matrices from text files. The program demonstrates basic file I/O operations, string parsing, and matrix multiplication. The results of the multiplication are printed to the console and saved to an output file.

# Features

Reads two matrices from text files (matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt).
Parses the text files to create two 2D vectors representing the matrices.
Multiplies the matrices if their dimensions are compatible.
Prints the result matrix to the console.
Saves the result matrix to an output file (matrixoutput.txt).


# How to Use
  1. Place your input matrices in matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt files.
  2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
