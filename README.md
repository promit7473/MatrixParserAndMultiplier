# MatrixParserAndMultiplier


This repository contains a C++ program that reads, parses, and multiplies two matrices from text files. The program demonstrates basic file I/O operations, string parsing, and matrix multiplication. The results of the multiplication are printed to the console.
# Features

Reads two matrices from text files (matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt).
Parses the text files to create two 2D vectors representing the matrices.
Multiplies the matrices if their dimensions are compatible.
Prints the result matrix to the console and the result get saved into the outputfile.txt


# How to Use
  1. Place your input matrices in input1.txt and input2.txt files.
  2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
